# Rezzr

Rezzr is a prototype of a resturant reservation system built in Vue.

## Frontend

The frontend is built entirely in Vue!

- Styling: [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io)
- Components: [Vue Date Picker](https://vue3datepicker.com/)

## Backend

This project was adapted from an older project. As such I left the backend in it's legacy state as an experiment in communication between modern and legacy apps.

- API: [overnight.js](https://github.com/seanpmaxwell/overnight)
- ORM: [sequelize 5](https://sequelize.org/)

# Running

`docker-compose up` will run the app! UI is on `8080` and api on `9090`
